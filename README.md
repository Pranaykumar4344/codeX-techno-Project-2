# 📊 Unemployment Analysis using Python 🚀

This project aims to uncover valuable insights about **global unemployment trends** using data analysis and visualization techniques in Python. By analyzing unemployment data from 2014 to 2024, the project provides a deep dive into the state of unemployment across various countries, gender differences, and age groups.

### 🌍 Project Overview:

The **Global Unemployment Data** is used to track unemployment rates across the globe, analyzing how it fluctuates over the years. With this analysis, we aim to understand:

* Global unemployment trends from 2014 to 2024 📈
* Gender and age group disparities in unemployment 👩‍💻👨‍💻
* The top countries with the highest and lowest unemployment rates 📍
* Changes in unemployment over time for various countries 🌏

🔗 **Dataset Source**:
The dataset is available on Kaggle. You can download it here:
[Global Unemployment Data - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/global-unemployment-data)
